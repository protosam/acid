A simplistic framework designed to include 1 file into your script to provide you with a full MVC patterned application. It is compatible with newer versions of PHP and also HHVM out of the box. The goal of slim is to keep PHP programming practices as simplistic as possible.  
  
__Setup__  
Out of the box, slim expects  you to be using a database, so it will require you to edit `lib/config.php` to provide it with database details. You can create files in `lib/database` and all of the files will be included automatically.  
  
__Todo List__  
* Create a light weight and non-restricting database abstraction layer. 
  
  
Further documentation will be created/provided soon.
